    <h1>Why is it important to learn about Greenhouse gases?</h1>
    <h4><br>Global Warming is known as the result from warming that greenhouse gases do from trapping heat in the atmosphere. Scientists have observed and pointed at humans as the main suspect of the cause of the warming trend that has been happening since the mid 20th century. Gases that have contributed to the greenhouse effect are ater vapor, Nitrous oxide, Methane, Carbon dioxide.</br>

<br>Water vapor is the most abundant gas, but acts as a feedback to the climate. Since the earth is warming and there's going to be more water vapor in the atmosphere, this gas will be very important in determining whether certain areas will be fertile or if they will have droughts.</br>

<br>Carbon dioxide makes up a minor part of the atmosphere, but it's the most important component that causes the temperature rise. Carbon dioxide can be relased naturally like from respiration and volcanic eruptions, and it can also be relased by human activities such as deforestation, land use, and the burning of fossil fuels. According to NASA, humans have increased the atmospheric Carbon dioxide levels by more than one third since the Industrial Revolution.</br>

<br>There are more greenhouse gases such as Methane, Nitrous Oxide, and Chlorofluorocarbons that pollute up the atmosphere. Methane is less abundant but is a more powerful gas that comes from the decomposition of landfills, agriculture, and manure from livestocks. Nitrous oxide, another power grennhouse gas, comes from the soil cultivation process, fertilizers, biomass burning, and etc. Chlorofluorocarbons also known as CFCs are synthetic compounds that are regulated in production and internationally agreed upon to be greatly harmful to the atmpshere.</br></h4>
