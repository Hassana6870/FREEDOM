<h1>The correlation between Natural Diasters and Climate change</h1>
 <h4><br>As global warming is increasing, there will be an increased global risk of droughts, an increase of intense storms, and more windy tropical storms. Most climate models all have models that show similar trends towards what weather events be become more or less common, and the increase of more hot or warm weather. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, more greenhouse gases in the atmosphere will boost temperatures of the land area of earth.<br>
 <br>Since global average temperature is increasing, we can say that there will be less cold weather, and a greater chance of record hot weather. We can also make more statements like if there's an increase in average temperature and variance, there will be less change in cold weather, and there will be more hot weather and more record hot weather.</br>
 <br>Moreover, as the global temperature rises, the number of intense storms will increase. We can say this because if more and more water is being evaporated into the atmosphere from more heat, and since water vapor is fuel for storms, then there will be probably an increase in intense storms. </br>
